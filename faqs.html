                                <strong>1. What types of bulbs are suitable for desk lamps?</strong>
                                <br /><br />Desk lamps often accommodate various types of bulbs, including LED, CFL
                                (Compact Fluorescent Lamp), and incandescent bulbs. LED bulbs are popular due to their
                                energy efficiency and long lifespan, while CFL bulbs offer similar benefits with a
                                different technology. Incandescent bulbs are less common due to their higher energy
                                consumption and shorter lifespan compared to LEDs and CFLs.

                                <strong>2. How do I choose the right brightness level for my desk lamp?</strong>
                                <br /><br />The brightness level of a desk lamp is measured in lumens. The ideal
                                brightness depends on the task and personal preference. For tasks requiring focused
                                lighting, such as reading or detailed work, a desk lamp with a higher lumen output
                                (around 450 to 800 lumens) is recommended. For ambient lighting or less demanding tasks,
                                lower lumen output may suffice. Adjustable brightness settings or dimmable lamps offer
                                flexibility to adjust the light intensity according to the need.

                                    functionality?</strong>
                                <br /><br />When selecting a desk lamp, consider features such as adjustable height,
                                swivel arm or head, and adjustable brightness settings. These features allow you to
                                customize the lighting angle and intensity to suit your specific task and comfort
                                preferences. Additionally, built-in USB ports for charging devices, integrated wireless
                                charging pads, or touch-sensitive controls are desirable features for added convenience.

                                comfort for various tasks. For reading, look for lamps with a focused beam and
                                adjustable brightness to reduce eye strain. Craft lamps often feature magnifying lenses
                                or daylight simulation to provide optimal lighting for intricate tasks. Task-specific
                                desk lamps come in a variety of styles and designs to cater to different needs and
